============================== UI Bugs ==============================
NEED to fix:

1) LearnMores need to truncate text better. Long texts overflow sideways but seem to stick within 2 lines.
   Change the titles to make it fit. (Impose a character count limit). --> Alex

3) Quiz results page needs to be an empty page if no rights selected. Also, add done button to Quiz UI --> Ryan
4) Tiles & Take Quiz button need to be dynamically sized (%) so that the flatlist doesn't scroll around. --> Alex
5) [DONE] Fix the Rights Category Modal text overlap issue. Reduce padding and limit text. Impose a maxHeight for modal. --> Angel
6) The flatlist on the Quiz page can also be panned around. Fix the learnMore touchable size. --> Angel
