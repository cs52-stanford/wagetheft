============================== UI Bugs ==============================
NEED to fix:

1) LearnMores need to truncate text better. Long texts overflow sideways but seem to stick within 2 lines. Change the titles to make it fit. (Impose a character count limit)
2) LearnMore title not centralized. Seems to have a constant padding from the left but not from the right.
3) Quiz results page needs to be an empty page if no rights selected. Also, add done button to Quiz UI
4) Tiles & Take Quiz button need to be dynamically sized (%) so that the flatlist doesn't scroll around.
5) Fix the Rights Category Modal text overlap issue. Reduce padding and limit text. Impose a maxHeight for modal.
6) The flatlist on the Quiz page can also be panned around. Fix the learnMore touchable size.
7) In Events page, when there are no "Your Events", there's a lack of space between "Your Events" and "Social".
8) The border shadows for Events cards are also being cut off
9) Make tweets clickable, add dates, sort the tweets by date.
10) Change the titling and add the question mark pop up thing for the Twitter Feed

******* NAME FOR THE APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! + ICON *********

Improvements:

LearnMore content needs larger padding (nicer).
Fix the loading thing for events
