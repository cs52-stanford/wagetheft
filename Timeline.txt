============================== UI Bugs ==============================
NEED to fix:

LearnMores need to truncate text better. Long texts overflow sideways but seem to stick within 2 lines.
LearnMore title not centralized. Seems to have a constant padding from the left but not from the right.
Quiz results page needs to be an empty page if no rights selected.
Improvements:

LearnMore content needs larger padding (nicer).
Make twitter posts clickable?
Add done button to Quiz UI
