Thus, these questions are usually justified so long as the job is for a religious position. Religious institutions justify questions about sexual history by arguing that while there is not a direct correlation, there is a strong relationship between child molesters and those who were abused when they were children. Therefore, the religious employers are protecting themselves from potential liability related to potential abuse by employees. The case of Broderick v.

However, even this general policy enforcing forced arbitration has limits.","header":""},{"body":"It is important to remember that state contract law governs whether an arbitration agreement is enforceable. So, while arbitration agreements are generally ok, a state's specific contract laws may make a particular arbitration agreement unenforceable depending on the facts of that case or contract. A good example of how this works is on the issue of consideration in contract law. One important concept in contract law is that a valid contract must be based on adequate \"consideration.\" This means that in order for a contract to be enforceable the benefit of the contract must be bargained for, in other words each party gets something of value in exchange for something else of value. In the context of arbitration, you are conferring a benefit on the employer by agreeing to arbitrate any future claims, and thus you should receive something of value in return. For instance, if an arbitration agreement is signed as part of the initial employment contract, your employment can be valid consideration - You give up your rights to potential legal action in exchange for a job. However, what constitutes valid consideration in the employment context varies from state to state. For instance, in Baker v. Bristol Care, Inc., the Supreme Court of Missouri held that an arbitration agreement lacked consideration where the agreement was based on continued employment (after the employee had already been hired). So, the Missouri court held that the employee's continued employment was not valuable enough to constitute consideration for the benefit gained by the employer (the agreement to arbitrate) - therefore, the agreement was unenforceable for lack of consideration. Courts in a different state might have a different outcome under the same facts based on the contract law of that state.","header":""},{"body":"One major exception to the general rule that forced arbitration agreements are legal also exists in the context of Federal contracting.

Workers’ compensation benefits may include  wage replacement, medical treatment, vocational rehabilitation, and other benefits The workers' compensation system evolved quickly after the turn of the 20th century in this country. Along with the industrial revolution came bigger, faster, and more complex machinery, and many more work place hazards. Congress passed the Workers' Compensation Act for federal employees in 1908. Each state has now passed workers' compensation laws providing benefits for workplace injuries and illness.  While the workers' compensation program is national, the states are responsible for implementing it, which means that important aspects of the program vary according to the laws of your state.  These laws were initially put in place to balance the rights of workers and employers and provide a way to settle differences quickly and privately. Both the employer and employee give up some legal rights under the workers' compensation laws of the various states. The employee gives up the right to go to court and sue his employer for on-the-job injuries which, in some states, could be for unlimited amounts of damages (although many states have passed laws capping the amount of damages). Instead, the worker is entitled to receive a definite award, based upon fixed maximums set by the various states.  In return, employers give up the right to deny responsibility due to potential negligence by the employee that may have contributed to the injury. The workers' compensation systems are considered \"no-fault\" systems. Employers finance the system primarily through insurance premiums, although in some states, companies may self-insure, which means that they pay all claims themselves.","header":""}],"title":"What is Workers' Comp?"},"-M8rLzbv4OiEPZUUZjR2":{"informationChunks":[{"body":"There are four different types of work-related injuries that qualify for workers’ compensation.

If you become permanently unable to do the work you were doing prior to the injury, or unable to do any work at all, you may be eligible to receive long-term or lump-sum benefits.

You may be required to undergo continuing medical examinations.  In addition, you may receive compensation for the loss of earning capacity you suffered if you are unable to resume regular work because of injury-related disability. This compensation is paid on the basis of the difference between your capacity to earn wages after an injury and the wages of the job you held when injured (compensation = wages of job before an injury - capacity to earn wages after an injury).","header":"Does the company have to pay for my medical care after I go back to work?"},{"body":"You do not pay tax on workers compensation received by you or your survivors for job related sickness or injuries paid under a workers compensation act or workers compensation statute.

If your employer continues to pay your regular salary or wages and requires you to turn over your workers compensation benefits, then you will be taxed on the excess amount, over and above your workers compensation benefits, that was paid to you by your employer.

Sometimes, a resignation can be helpful. When you apply for new jobs, you can honestly say that you quit the company voluntarily. Your employment record at your old company should reflect that you quit and not that you were fired. For some large companies with numerous affiliates or divisions, an employee who resigns from the job is eligible for rehire with the company at a later date, whereas an employee terminated for cause would not be.","header":""},{"body":"However, the difference between being fired or discharged and voluntarily quitting is significant in a number of ways. Whether to resign or be fired is a matter of strategy and depends on the facts of your situation. Before you resign, consult an employment attorney if you can.

The information below gives some of the general reasons that resignation can be either helpful or harmful depending on the circumstances.","header":""},{"body":"It may be that your employer wants to fire you and is making life at work difficult for you, hoping you will quit. The company may refrain from terminating you out of fear that the dismissal would be illegal. Under these circumstances, you may be better off not resigning. If you resign voluntarily, you may be unable to claim an illegal discharge. Assume your employer wants you out but doesn't want to take the possibly unlawful step of discharge. You then can increase your bargaining power with your employer by staying and refusing to resign. You can use the company's desire for your departure as leverage for obtaining a generous separation package in exchange for your resignation. In general, you should try to remain at the job as long as you can to increase your bargaining position. Finally, if your company has an internal grievance procedure, you can appeal the wrongful discharge. If you quit you may not have the right of appeal and your chances of regaining your job (if that is your objective) would be greatly diminished.","header":""},{"body":"If your employment situation is unbearable because of illegal discrimination, you should still try to remain on the job as long as possible. Meanwhile, contact the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the state agency that investigates claims of discrimination. You are protected from retaliation for filing an EEOC charge or contacting an EEOC investigator. Therefore, any plan to fire you may be put aside at least while the investigation is going on, since the employer does not want to appear to have fired you for filing with the EEOC. For more information about filing a discrimination claim, please see our section on discrimination.","header":""},{"body":"Ordinarily, when an employee proves that he or she was discriminated against by a former employer, the employee is entitled to \"back pay,\" the amount that the employee would have earned at the company had he or she not been discriminatorily terminated. However, if you resign your position because of harassment or discrimination, you would not be entitled to recover back pay unless your resignation is considered a \"constructive discharge.\" To prove constructive discharge, you must prove that your employer made your working conditions so unbearable that you had no other choice but to quit in order to resolve the situation. Usually, you have to show that you tried less drastic means to solve the work problems, such as using an internal appeal process or making complaints to people in the chain of command. A constructive discharge is very hard to prove except in cases of truly egregious harassment. Thus, a resignation might seriously affect your ability to recover for an employer's discriminatory behavior.","header":""},{"body":"As stated earlier, resignation is a matter of strategy and depends on the facts of your situation and your needs after you leave the company.
